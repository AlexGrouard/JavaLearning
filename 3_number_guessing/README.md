3. Number Guessing Game
This is a simple game that can help you get your feet wet with Java. The game is relatively simple â€” the computer generates a random number, and the user must guess the number. The computer will then let the user know that their guess is too high, too low, or correct. This can be free-form, allowing an unlimited number of guesses, or give the user a set number of guesses before the game ends. I choose to limit guesses a 10.
